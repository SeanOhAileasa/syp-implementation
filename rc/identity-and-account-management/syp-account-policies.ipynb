    "The implementation of user passwords on a system is a topic that is of great debate in the industry - there are many ideas and proposals on what the best password implementation might be, so you may want to check internally with your organization and see what the best set of policies would be for you.\n",

    "The idea behind setting these password policies is to have a password that is considered to be strong - this means that it would resist being guessed by someone, or have someone perform a brute force attack and be able to reverse engineer what that password is. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we need to increase the entropy associated with this password - password entropy is a way to measure just how unpredictable a password might be, so we don’t want to use any single words and we don’t want to use any passwords that might be obvious, such as the name of your dog and if you use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters all at the same time in the password, it makes it much more difficult to guess and much more difficult to brute force.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn’t mean that you should start replacing letters with numbers that are very similar, for example, you would not replace a ``0`` with an ``O`` or replace the letter ``T`` with the number ``7``. The attackers have brute force systems that are already designed to replace these letters with these numbers because this is such a common thing for people to do. Instead, you want to use a random set of letters and numbers and you want to be sure that it’s not something that could be guessed by a third-party piece of software.\n",

    "One way to prevent an attacker from using a live system to perform a brute force attack would be to implement an account lockout policy - this means that after a certain number of incorrect passwords, the account is automatically locked and even if the attacker was to eventually find the correct password, they would have no idea because the system has already locked that account and made it so that it would not be accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, undoubtedly, the norm for most organizations accounts - that way they can be assured that no one is performing a brute force attack on their live systems - this can be especially problematic if the attackers are trying to brute force a service account because then the services that rely on that account could be locked out and you would have to manually go in and re-enable that service. Unlike a user account, when a service account is locked, it could affect a large number of people. An administrator to disabled the brute force protection and account lockout policy for a service account, is generally not considered a good best practice - probably want to know when someone is performing a brute force attack and if someone locks that account, then you would have at least an idea that particular system is under attack.\n",
    "\n",

Each of these have different levels of accuracy associated with them, but combined together, you might get a pretty good idea of where someone might be.\n",

    "Might combine this location with a policy that uses geofencing. Geofencing allows you to set a policy on where a user might be physically located, so if someone is inside the building, there may be a set of policies associated with their account but if they are outside the building or if they’re in another city, there may be a completely different set of policies.\n",

    "Can take all of these different location based policies and combine them together into one single permission, for example, you can check an IP address and see that someone trying to log in is associated with an IP address block that is assigned to Russia - would notice that we don’t have an office in Russia and perhaps more importantly, that user was in Colorado Springs just an hour ago. This makes it very difficult for us to believe that this user could now be somehow located in Russia - this means this user would not be granted permission to log in and we may have additional security controls in place because we may believe that this user’s account could be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Might also combine this with time based policies - there may be, for example, a lab that should only be used during normal working hours but if someone tries to access that lab at 3:00 in the morning, we might have an alert fire to tell us that something unusual is occurring and we would prevent access for that user."
